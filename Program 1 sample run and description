Description of code:
This code runs a for loop as long as the value of I is less than 5000. For each iteration of the loop it first checks if the value of I is lower than 5000, and if it is, it multiplies the current value of I by 2 and adds 1 and then it stores the result as the new value of I . Then the result is printed showing the current value of I and the loop runs again provided t follows the conditions
